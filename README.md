# CryptoGrindRailRun

The Cryptogrind Railroad is only accessible in passageways of the Wulff Net in an upper compartment, which means that in order to recieve a true message from the Wullf, the orders must come from a conductor on native Earth. 

The CryptogrindRailRun flows through Upsidedownland and inside out, in a backwards direction, making it the furthest away from Earths Dimension, and a ghost, if you follow the rules of untangling Curtain Rails, everyone ought to be safe.
